# spark-sql2o-orm
In this project object persistence is managed using the SQL2o library, which simplifies the conversion of SQL query results into objects. The goal is to implement Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in a straightforward manner, enabling persistence of application data in a database while maintaining integrity between objects and the database.
